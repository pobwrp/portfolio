# Portfolio

This is a collection of the data-engineering work I’ve shipped across different stacks.

## What you'll find
- `credit_risk_platform/` – Airflow TaskFlow DAG orchestrating a Spark random-forest trainer for credit scoring.
- `integration_suite/` – Databricks asset bundle with bidirectional ingestion, Kafka streaming, SharePoint exports, and reusable configuration utilities.
- `devops_ci_cd/` – CI/CD automation snippets (Jenkins pipelines + GitHub Actions) I use to deploy Databricks bundles and MWAA-based Airflow.
